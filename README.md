# UnlockTheBox
Final Java Project for School (15 hrs)

Synopsis

This is the my final project for JAVA in school. They ask me to create a program of my own choosing. I chose to make a simple fast game to play. 

Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

Motivation

I enjoy fast simple games and I wanted to focus on the GUI of Java. I also wanted something that would fit within my schools alotted time frame to complete the project of 15 hours. I completed the project in less time so I could have maybe made it slightly more complex.


Tests

By downloading the UnlockTheBox and UnlockTheBoxDemo in java, then run the UnlockTheBoxDemo you can run and test the game.
