# UnlockTheBox
Final Java Project for School (15 hrs)

Synopsis

This is the my final project for JAVA in school. They ask me to create a program of my own choosing. I chose to make a simple fast game to play. 



Motivation

I enjoy fast simple games and I wanted to focus on the GUI of Java. I also wanted something that would fit within my schools alotted time frame of 15 hours to complete the project. I completed the project in less time so I could have maybe made it slightly more complex.


Tests

By downloading the UnlockTheBox.zip, unzip and launch and UnlockTheBoxDemo in coderunner on mac, then run the UnlockTheBoxDemo to test the game.

******Made some modifications but didn't want to change my screenshots. See UnlockTheBox.java in the UnlockTheBox.zip.******
